# EXAMUS MOODLE PLUGIN

## Requirements
1. Examus plugin was tested with Moodle 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 version.
2. Examus proctoring needs an OAuth2 server plugin installed.
    * You can download the plugin from https://github.com/examus/moodle-local_oauth/releases (ZIP archive). To install it, login to your Moodle site as an admin, go to `Site administration → Plugins → Install plugins`, upload the ZIP file and install the plugin as prompted.
    * If you have an OAuth2 server plugin installed from another source, **please make sure it allows HTTPS url as Redirect URL**.

## Installation and integration

### Plugin installation
Download ZIP file from https://github.com/examus/moodle-availability_examus/releases/, login to your Moodle site as an admin, open `Site administration → Plugins → Install plugins`, upload the ZIP file and install it.

### Setting up a user for the integration
Due to security reasons, it's recommended to have a separate user with special permissions for the integration.
1. Create a new user, for example, `examus`. To do that, go to `Site administration → Users → Accounts → Add a new user`. Fill the required fields. Create a password for the user.
2. Create a new role for the integration, for example, `webservice`. Go to `Site administration → Users → Permissions → Define roles`. Click the `Add a new role` button. Choose a role archetype `Authenticated user` as a basis. Click `Continue`.
3. Select the context `System` where this role can be assigned.
In the bottom part of the page, allow the following capabilities:
    - local/rcommon:authenticate
    - Use REST protocol
Fill in all other required fields: `Short name`, `Custom full name`.
Click the `Create this role` button.
4. Go to `Site administration → Users → Permissions → Assign system roles`. Choose the role created in the previous step (`webservice`). Add the previously created `examus` user to the `Existing users` field.

### Enabling web services
1. Go to `Site administration → Advanced features`. Enable web services. Save changes.
2. Go to `Site administration → Plugins → Web services → Manage protocols`. Enable the REST protocol. Save changes.

### Creating a web service token
1. Go to `Site administration → Plugins → Web services → Manage tokens`, click `Add`.
2. Add a token for the service `Examus` for the previously created user `examus` (or Admin User). Leave the IP restriction field empty.
3. Send the token to Examus. We will use this token for integration.

### Creating a new OAuth client
The new client will be used by Examus proctoring service to authenticate your users.
1. Please contact us to get your 'Redirect URL'.
2. Go to `Site administration → Server → OAuth provider settings`, click `Add new client`. You can use any `Client identifier`, for example, `examus`. Paste the received 'Redirect URL'. Save changes.
3. Sent the `Client identifier` and `Client secret` values to Examus. We will use them for integration.

## Usage
